TurboGraph-master
=================

TurboGraph is an engine that lets you easily apply bitmap caching on MovieClips in Flash. 
BitmapCaching is used to boost performance for gaming, but it can be tedious to implement.
The engine digs through the display hierarchy, and derrives a layer with all the needed
bitmaps, also saving memory by eliminating duplicate BitmapDatas and does some self cleaning.

Instructions on how to use TurboGraph will come...
